The CSS property `content` is used with the `::before` and `::after` pseudo-elements to insert generated content.  However, if the `content` property is set to a value that contains a string with unescaped quotes (single or double) inside it, and that string is not properly escaped, it can lead to unexpected behavior, rendering errors, or even CSS parsing issues.  The browser's CSS parser might interpret the unescaped quotes as the end of the string, leading to truncated content or errors.
